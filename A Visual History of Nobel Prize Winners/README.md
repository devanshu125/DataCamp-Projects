# A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners:milky_way:

This project is about exploring a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) from Kaggle containing a century's
worth of Nobel Laureates. Some of the tasks I try to explore are -
- Country-wise distribution of Nobel Prize winners
- Visualizing USA's dominance
- What is the gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner?
- Age differences between prize categories
