# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language
Exploring development history of Scala in Git and GitHub.

Datasets
1. [pulls.csv](datasets/pulls.csv) - Contains basic information about pull requests.
2. [pull_files.csv](datasets/pull_files.csv) - Contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

Tried to answer questions like -
- Is the project still actively maintained?
- Is there camaraderie in the project?
- What files were changed in the last ten pull requests?
- Who made the most pull requests to a given file?
- Who made the last ten pull requests on a given file?

Lastly, I would like to thank [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) for this amazing project!
